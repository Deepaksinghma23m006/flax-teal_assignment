## Introduction

The Burgers' equation is a fundamental partial differential equation from fluid mechanics, combining nonlinear convection and diffusion. It serves as a model for various physical phenomena. This project demonstrates how to numerically solve the Burgers' equation using the RK4 method.

## Mathematical Formulation

The Burgers' equation is given by:

\[ u_t + u u_x = \nu u_{xx} \]

where:
- \(u\) is the velocity field
- \(t\) is time
- \(x\) is the spatial coordinate
- \(\nu\) is the viscosity coefficient

## Numerical Method

To solve this equation numerically:
1. Discretize the spatial domain into a grid.
2. Use finite difference approximations for the spatial derivatives.
3. Apply the RK4 method to update the solution in time.

## Results

The following output was obtained from running the Python code provided in this repository, showing the evolution of the solution over time.
